1. React and spring-boot tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/

## To Run

 - Run this on a separate terminal window at all times: npm run-script watch
 - If you do not, then the code will not update
 - You must relaunch the server everytime you make a change (sorry I don't know how to change this)
 - To run code, do: ./mvnw spring-boot:run
